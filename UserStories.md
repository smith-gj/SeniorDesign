1) When I wear the AR Headset, I want to be able to see speech bubbles appear when people in my field of view speak. The speech bubbles should be to one side of the speaker's head.

2) As a deaf user, I want a visual que to know how loud or soft someone is speaking. I expect to see the speech bubble shrink or grow based on volume.

3) When someone is speaking behind me I want to see a speech bubble all the way to one side of my field of view with an arrow telling me where the sound is coming from. This 
   bubble should also be greyed out as a que that the speaker is not in my field of view.

4) When I am wearing the headset and talking, I don't want to see a speech bubble for myself.
