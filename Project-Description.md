## Project Background ##
Deafness is an ailment which affects many people. Estimates are around one in every ten people has some form of hearing loss. Beyond that, there exist countries with multiple national languages. Tourists visiting these countries must either learn those dialects or only visit countries which are friendly towards their mother tongue. This causes an undue hardship.

## Problem Statement ##
Make it easier for people to understand languages with which they are not fluent, or can't even hear at all.

## Inadequacy of Current Solutions ##
Current implementations which solve this problem are not robust. Google translate is of course a ubiquitous approach to this situation. However, it's real time capabilities are lacking. It involves a user staring at their phone and hoping Google picks up the phrase and waits for the translation. It lacks a human element.

## Background Skills/Interests ##
We all enjoy travel and experiencing other cultures, and we want to make an impact with our work.

Each of us are interested in the fields of augmented reality and virtual reality. This project will allow us to utilize these technologies while also solving a real-world problem in a way that is impactful. We all have experience with software and working with third party APIs, so we are all prepared to learn new technologies as necessary through documentation.

## Our Approach ##
Implement a real-time subtitle system in Augmented Reality. As phrases are detected by our AR interface, it is then translated to the user-selected language. For those who are entirely deaf, this will allow them to understand conversations. For those who are speaking to someone else who speaks a foreign language, they will be better able to comprehend and convey ideas while maintaining the human element of conversation, being able to view body language and actually see their partner speak.
